# skoot

Skoot is a lightweight python library of machine learning transformer classes 
that interact with [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn)
and [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas). 
Its objective is to expedite data munging and pre-processing tasks that can
tend to take up so much of data science practitioners' time.

__Note that skoot is the preferred 
alternative to the now deprecated [skutil](https://github.com/tgsmith61591/skutil) 
library__
